# Kanagawa Tmux

A clean, dark Tmux theme based off of Hokusai Katsushika's painting,
[The Great Wave off Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim)
The perfect companion for [tokyonight-vim](https://github.com/ghifarit53/tokyonight-vim)
Adapted from the original, [Visual Studio Code theme](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme).
The old version (deprecated) is still available in the `legacy` branch.

## About this theme

This is a very opinionated project, as I am a Tech Lead, this theme is very developer-focused.

## Requirements

### Nerd Fonts

This theme requires the use of a patched font with Nerd Font. Ensure your
terminal is set to use one before installing this theme. Any patched font will
do. See [`nerdfonts.com`](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for more informations.

### Noto Fonts

This theme requires the Noto fonts to be installed on your operating system.
Make sure your operating system has the needed font and is configured to use one.

### Installation using TPM

In your `tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set -g @plugin "chabitblunk/kanagawa-tmux"
```

### Configuration

#### Number styles

Run this

```bash
tmux set @tokyo-night-tmux_window_id_style digital
tmux set @tokyo-night-tmux_pane_id_style hsquare
tmux set @tokyo-night-tmux_zoom_id_style dsquare
```

or add this lines to your  `.tmux.conf`

```tmux
set -g @tokyo-night-tmux_window_id_style digital
set -g @tokyo-night-tmux_pane_id_style hsquare
set -g @tokyo-night-tmux_zoom_id_style dsquare
```

The styles:

- `none`: no style, default font
- `digital`: 7 segment number (üØ∞...üØπ) (needs [Unicode support](https://github.com/janoamaral/tokyo-night-tmux/issues/36#issuecomment-1907072080)) 
- `roman`: roman numbers (Û±Çà...Û±Çê) (needs nerdfont)
- `fsquare`: filled square (Û∞é°...Û∞éº) (needs nerdfont)
- `hsquare`: hollow square (Û∞é£...Û∞éæ) (needs nerdfont)
- `dsquare`: hollow double square (Û∞é°...Û∞éº) (needs nerdfont)
- `super`: superscript symbol (‚Å∞...‚Åπ)
- `sub`: subscript symbols (‚ÇÄ...‚Çâ)

### New tokyonight Highlights ‚ö°

Everything works out the box now. No need to modify anything and colors are hard-
coded, so it's independent of terminal theme.

- Local git stats.
- Web based git server (GitHub/GitLab) stats.
  - Open PR count
  - Open PR reviews count
  - Issue count
- Remote branch sync indicator (you will never forget to push or pull again ü§™).
